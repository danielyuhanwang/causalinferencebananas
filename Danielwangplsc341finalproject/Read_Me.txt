In my project 'Causal Inference of Bananas,' I decided to test folk wisdom of whether putting aluminum foil on banana stems increases the times it takes for a banana to ripen.
In this folder, "Danielwangplsc341finalproject_writeup.pdf" is my 10-page writeup and analysis of my experiment. "banana_data_complete.csv" is my dataset, and my script is "danielwang_plsc341final_R.R". The 'Visualizations' folder contains the images and graphs I included in my write up.
